# Embymalism

A Finimalism inspired CSS theme for Emby Media Servers Web Client


## Installation

Paste the following Code into "Dashboard -> General -> Custom CSS"

```
@import url("https://raw.githack.com/v1rusnl/Embymalism/main/Embymalism.css");
```

The Import URL in this Readme is always the latest. 
When Emby version changes, I will bump the CSS as soon as I have time to check for HTML/CSS code changes.
